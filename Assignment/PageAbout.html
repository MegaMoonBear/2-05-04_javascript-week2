    <p> APOPO is a global nonprofit organization that harnesses the extraordinary sense of smell of African giant pouched rats to tackle some of the world’s most persistent health and humanitarian challenges. Originally founded to detect landmines, the organization has expanded its mission to include public health, particularly tuberculosis (TB), one of the deadliest infectious diseases worldwide. In high-burden countries, where diagnostic resources are often limited, APOPO’s rats provide a cost-effective, scalable, and remarkably efficient way to support healthcare systems.

    <p> In TB detection, trained HeroRATs can evaluate hundreds of sputum samples in a fraction of the time it would take a laboratory technician. Their work dramatically improves case-finding, especially for patients whose infections might be overlooked by traditional microscopy. This innovative approach not only accelerates diagnosis and treatment but also reduces transmission within communities. By integrating science, local partnerships, and an unconventional yet proven tool, APOPO demonstrates how creativity and compassion can converge to solve urgent global problems.
