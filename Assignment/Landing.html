        <p> Tuberculosis is now the world’s leading cause of death from an infectious disease. “HeroRATs” help.
        <p/>
            
        <p> APOPO trains African giant pouched rats to rapidly detect tuberculosis in human sputum samples. These highly accurate, non-invasive screenings help identify cases often missed by conventional tests. By combining innovative science with an unlikely partner, APOPO saves lives and speeds up access to treatment.
